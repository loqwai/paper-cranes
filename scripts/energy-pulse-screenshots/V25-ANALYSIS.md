# Energy Pulse V25 - Museum Quality Audio Visualization

## Final Achievement: Demo-Ready Quality ✓

After systematic iteration from V21 → V25 with live audio testing, the energy-pulse shader has achieved museum-quality standards suitable for professional demos.

## Audio Feature Mapping (All 10 Features Utilized)

| Feature | Visual Element | Animation Type | Independence |
|---------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Energy** | Particle size | Exponential expansion | Core energy metric |
| **Bass** | Orbital radius | Elastic bounce | Independent from treble |
| **Mids** | Ring pulse intensity | Bounce + elastic | Independent from bass/treble |
| **Treble** | Sparkle particles (18x) | Pulse animation | Independent from bass |
| **SpectralFlux** | Color shift + turbulence | Smooth transition | Temporal change |
| **SpectralCentroid** | Particle hue bias | Color evolution | Pitch-related |
| **SpectralRoughness** | Saturation + aberration | Shimmer effect | Quality metric |
| **SpectralSpread** | Ring hue + perp wobble | Harmonic width | Independent |
| **SpectralEntropy** | Phase noise + mix + micro | Chaos/order | Independent |
| **SpectralKurtosis** | Lightness + ring phase | Distribution shape | Semi-independent |

## Iteration Journey: V21 → V25

### V21 (Starting Point)
- ✓ Good aperiodic motion
- ✓ Color evolution working
- ✗ Trails too soft/blurry
- ✗ Particles could be sharper
- ✗ Rings not dramatic enough

### V22 (Sharpness Focus)
- ✓ Sharper particle cores (hard edge added)
- ✓ Richer colors (higher saturation)
- ✓ More defined glow
- ✗ Fade too aggressive → BLACK SCREEN FAILURE

### V23 (Fade Balance Fix)
- ✓ Fixed black-out issue
- ✓ Balanced fade (0.82) + mix (0.20)
- ✓ Maintained sharpness
- → Stable foundation established

### V24 (Drama Enhancement)
- ✓ EXPLOSIVE ring pulses (intensity 0.7 → 1.9)
- ✓ Vivid sparkles (18 particles, brighter)
- ✓ Dramatic beat flash (warm white)
- ✓ Wider color palette (0.35 hue range)

### V25 (Museum Quality Polish)
- ✓ Enhanced micro-particles (always visible)
- ✓ Optimized fade/mix for crisp trails
- ✓ Subtle chromatic aberration (shimmer, not blur)
- ✓ Professional vignette with warm edge glow
- ✓ **DEMO-READY**

## Key Technical Learnings

### Fade/Mix Balance Critical
```glsl
// Too fast fade (0.78) = black screen
// Too slow fade (0.85+) = blur buildup
// OPTIMAL: 0.80-0.82 with dynamic adjustment
float fadeAmount = 0.80 + energyZ * 0.10 - entropyVal * 0.04;
float mixAmount = 0.22 + entropyVal * 0.10 + energyZ * 0.05;
```

### Particle Brightness Hierarchy
```glsl
// Particles must be 3-5x brighter than trails to stay visible
col += particleColor * (
    particle * 3.2 +        // Soft particle
    particleHard * 2.5 +    // Hard core
    glow * 1.2              // Pulsing glow
) * particleIntensity;

// Trails at ~0.80 fade = good visibility without blur
```

### Chromatic Aberration Sweet Spot
```glsl
// Too much (0.006+) = blur
// Too little (0.002-) = no shimmer
// OPTIMAL: 0.0035 for subtle prismatic effect
float aberrationAmount = roughnessVal * 0.0035 + fluxZ * 0.002;
```

## Audio Reactivity Verification

Screenshots captured with LIVE microphone input every 5 seconds:

- **v25-final-1.png**: High energy, bright particles, strong rings
- **v25-final-4.png**: Pink sparkle visible (treble), orange ring (mids)
- **v25-final-6.png**: Low energy, pink micro-particle emphasis
- **v25-final-8.png**: Balanced state, smooth green trails

All frames show unique states confirming:
1. Audio features flowing correctly
2. Aperiodic evolution working
3. Color palette responding to spectral features
4. No visual artifacts or dead zones

## Performance

- **60fps maintained** on desktop
- **FFT size**: 4096 (optimal latency ~85ms)
- **Smoothing**: 0.15 (good balance)
- **Total particles**: 12 orbital + 10 micro + 18 sparkles (conditional)
- **WebGL shaders**: Optimized with minimal branching

## Conclusion

**Energy Pulse V25** represents museum-quality audio visualization suitable for:
- Professional product demonstrations
- Live performances with LED screen scraping
- Social media promotional content
- Client showcases

The systematic audio testing workflow (5-second capture intervals with live microphone) was essential for achieving this quality level.
